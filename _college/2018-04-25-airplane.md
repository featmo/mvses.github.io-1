As part of our fiinal year assignment in college we were asked to shade texture and light an airplane onto a backplate in VRay, the finsish the final composition in nuke, this was my final render from nuke. The image has been optimised for web viewing so the quality does not hold true to my final render, I'll most likely be uploaded along with other college projects onto my behance
