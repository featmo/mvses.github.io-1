Hi My name is Moses, I'm a designer from Ireland. This site is a curation of my projects.
<br>
<br>
I was studying computer science and software engineering for 3 years before deciding to change my career to art and design. I worked for a small graphic design studio in improving my eye for design, and am now currently studying 3d and VFX.
